A private repo for the Fall 2021 Chainlink Hackathon (Tsunami Project).

Running on Windows, I found that this walkthrough was the eaisest for installing Solana (https://medium.com/@sncryldrm/setup-solana-development-environment-on-windows-cbed9e42ccef).  I changed the

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.6.8/install)"

command to

sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.8.2/install)"
